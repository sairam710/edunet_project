# edunet_project
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of text-based image steganography. The primary goal is to embed textual information seamlessly into digital images while maintaining the visual quality of the cover image. Through this process, the hidden text remains concealed within the image and can only be extracted by those with knowledge of the embedding technique
